                <p>This photo was created while I was attending high school at <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;">La Feria.</span> 
                 The photo was made using Adobe Photoshop. To create the planet I used an image of dried mud which would give the exploding planet depth.
                 I chose green for my planet because it is my favorite color. </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>To create this image I attended a <strong>photojounalism</strong> class that allowed me to learn and use photoshop to create projects.
                     Being apart of this class made me learn how photoshop is used for buisinesses to make eyecatching images. 
                     I plan to someday use photoshop so I can create projects for myself or workplace.</p>

                <p>I started working as a <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;">freelance camera man </span> in 2019.
                    Currently I work for MITV and Bert Ogden Arena productions.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>When I first started, I knew nothing about camera but quickly <strong>adapted</strong> to the challenge. It took some time however; I was able to prove myself and began getting paid.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I still am learning more as I continue to work and really enjoy the <i>work environment</i> I'm in.</p>
